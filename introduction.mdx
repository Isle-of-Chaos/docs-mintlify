## What is QRBTF

QRBTF stands for "QR Code Beautifier" and it born out of a university course project. It was then that we began using methods of generative art to hide the QR codes within lines, bubbles, pixel art, and a variety of other intriguing patterns. The project has been open-sourced on GitHub, and remains accessible at [classic.qrbtf.com](https://classic.qrbtf.com).

In June 2023, pioneering the fusion of QR codes with generative AI, we utilized ControlNet and Stable Diffusion to create the world's first AI-generated QR code. Afterward, we shared it on platforms like Reddit, where it garnered widespread attention.

Today, you can try generating a wide array of QR codes on our website. Give it a go!
